Multi-Core Neural Network Simulation Using








  















Processes and Threads







 















 









Problem Statement






 









This project aims to simulate a neural network architecture on a multi-core processor by leveraging operating system-level constructs such as processes and threads. Each layer of the neural network is implemented as a separate process, while individual neurons within a layer are represented as threads. This design takes advantage of parallel processing capabilities in modern multi-core systems to enhance computational efficiency during forward and backward signal propagation. Inter-process communication (IPC) is handled via pipes, allowing seamless transfer of weights, biases, and computed outputs between layers. The project focuses on illustrating forward and backward passes and does not perform actual weight updates or full error handling. 









Project Description






  








Neural networks are a widely used machine learning technique that simulates the structure and functioning of the human brain to address complex computational problems. A typical neural network comprises interconnected layers of neurons, where each neuron accepts multiple inputs, processes them, and generates an output signal. 








In modern multi-core processors, multiple processing units (cores) can execute threads simultaneously, thereby significantly increasing computational throughput. To harness this capability, the proposed operating system will parallelize neural network computations across multiple cores. 
















































 










User Inputs and Configuration






 









The neural network configuration is determined by user input at runtime: 
















Number of hidden layers



: The user specifies the total number of hidden layers in the network. 















Number of neurons in each layer



: The user sets the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the output layer. Both layers should have equal number of neurons.  









Network weights and input values are read from a file named 






input.txt



. Each layer reads the weights corresponding to its neurons and applies them to the input signals it receives from the preceding layer.  









Neural Network Architecture

Input Layer 









The input layer initializes the network with raw input values from the file. It contains exactly two neurons, each represented as a separate thread. Each neuron computes its weighted contribution to the next layer using the following formula: 


















The neuron output is equal to the sum from 








i








 equals 1 








to n








 of input sub 








i








 multiplied by weight sub 








i








.










where 






o






 



n 




=  number




 of inputs to the neuron 






o






 



input







𝑖



= input from previous layer 







o







 



weight







𝑖



= corresponding weight from file 




The




 outputs from all neurons are aggregated and sent to the subsequent layer process via a pipe as input. 

















Hidden Layers



 









Each hidden layer is implemented as a separate process. The neurons within a hidden layer are represented as threads, each calculating their activation based on the input received from the previous layer. The process workflow is as follows:






 













Read input values from the pipe connected to the previous layer. 






o






 



Read the corresponding weights for each neuron from input.txt. 












Spawn threads to perform the weighted input calculations concurrently. 






o






 



Aggregate the outputs of all neurons and send them through a pipe to the next layer. 






o






 



Illustratively handle backward signals by printing propagated values. 








This structure allows multiple neuron threads to execute simultaneously across processor cores, maximizing parallelism. 

















Output Layer 









The output layer reads the aggregated inputs from the previous layer and applies weights using threads. After that, it computes the sum of all weighted inputs to generate output.






 









Then the following two formulas are applied to the generated output:






 

















f of x sub 1 is equal to the quantity output squared plus output plus 1, all divided by 2.









 



f of x sub 2 is equal to the quantity output squared minus output, all divided by 2.
















 








These outputs are sent backward to the previous layer through the pipe, simulating a basic backward pass. Once the backward pass reaches the input layer, the network performs one additional forward pass, using 






𝑓(𝑥








1






)



and




 






𝑓(𝑥







2






)



 as new input values for the input neurons. 










All output values, including those from both forward passes and the computed 












𝑓(𝑥








1






)



and




 






𝑓(𝑥







2






)



, are written to output.txt. 

















































 









Process and Thread Representation






 









Each layer of the neural network will be represented as a separate process. Each neuron within a layer will be implemented as an individual thread.  









Inter-Process Communication (IPC)






 









The system will employ pipes as the primary mechanism for inter-process communication. Through these pipes, neural network parameters such as inputs, weights and outputs will be exchanged between processes. A batch-based processing approach enables distributed computation, where each process handles a portion of the input batch sequentially through the pipeline. 









Concurrency Control and Locking Mechanisms






 









To prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity, the operating system will use locking mechanisms (such as mutexes or semaphores) to control access to shared resources. Only one thread or process will be allowed to modify shared data (e.g., weights and biases) at any given time. 










Backpropagation






  








No actual weight updates or gradient calculations are performed. The backward signal from the output layer (i.e., 






𝑓(𝑥








1






)



and




 






𝑓(𝑥







2






)



) is sent back through the layers via pipes for demonstration. Once the backward propagation reaches the input layer, the network performs another forward pass using these values as new inputs. 








This simplified mechanism visually represents backpropagation flow without altering any network parameters. 
















































 














 















Implementation Details:







 














The program should print appropriate status messages during execution, showing the progress of each layer and the results of both forward passes.






 













Your program should not be hardcoded for a fixed number of layers or neurons.







 













Inputs and weights for neurons should be read from a file (e.g., file.txt), not hardcoded in the program.







 













Output result is stored in an output.txt file.







 












Close all files and pipes after use, destroy semaphores/mutexes and remove pipes using 




unlink(




) when done.
