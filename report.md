## Title & Team Details
- Project title: Multi-Core Neural Network Simulation Using Processes and Threads
- Team members: (list names and roll numbers)

## Problem Statement
- Brief: Simulate a neural network where each layer is a process and each neuron is a thread.

## System Design & Architecture
- Describe: process-per-layer, thread-per-neuron, pipes for IPC, mutexes for intra-process synchronization.

## Implementation Details
- Forward pass 1 and 2, backward propagation simulation, dynamic process/thread creation, input/output handling, resource cleanup.

## Sample Output
- Include screenshots or paste of `output.txt` showing layer-wise forward and backward outputs.

## Work Division
- Who implemented which modules.

## Challenges Faced
- Any difficulties, debugging notes, and how they were resolved.

## References
- Course material and man pages for fork/pipe/pthread.
